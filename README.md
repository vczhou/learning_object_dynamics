# Learning Object Dynamics

FRI Fall 2016 Independent Research Project

Autonomous Intelligence Robotics Stream

The Learning Object Dynamics project proposes to teach the arm robot in the BWI lab to understand the consequences of it's actions (i.e. push and drop) on objects.

Road map:
- [x] Create Repository
- [ ] Set up ROS Project Skeleton
- [ ] Determine how teach/ program robots to perform actions with parameters (i.e. height and force used)
- [ ] Find groups of objects to collect data from
- [ ] Collect raw data from performing actions on objects (visual frames during extent of action)
- [ ] Extract features from data (position/ orientation of arm and object, tracetory object took)
- [ ] Feed input and output data into machine learning algorithms
- [ ] Create Final Presentation Papers
